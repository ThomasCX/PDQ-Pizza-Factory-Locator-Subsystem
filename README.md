# FactoryLocator

<h1>Description</h1>
<br>
<br>
This project is responsible for processing large amounts of data, (such as pizza order locations and traffic data) in order to determine the ideal location for a new pizza factory.
<br>
<br>
This is an elixir project. APIs can be ran from the terminal using the command:
elixir -r [file_name] -e [command_within_file]
<br>
<br>
A system-wide installation of elixir is required for this API to function as expected. To mitigate this a DOCKERFILE has been provided. Therefore you can access the APIs without having elixir installed.
<br>

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `factory_locator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
